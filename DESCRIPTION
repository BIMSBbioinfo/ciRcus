Description: A package for annotation, analysis and visualization of circRNA data. Users
             can annotate their circRNA candidates with host genes, gene featrues they
             are spliced from, and discriminate between known and yet unknown splice
             junctions. Circular-to-linear ratios of circRNAs can be calculated, and a
             number of descriptive plots easily generated.
