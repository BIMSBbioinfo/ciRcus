Description: A package for annotation, analysis and visualization of circRNA
    data. Users can annotate their circRNA candidates with host genes, gene featrues
    they are spliced from, and discriminate between known and yet unknown splice
    junctions. Circular-to-linear ratios of circRNAs can be calculated, and a number
    of descriptive plots easily generated.
