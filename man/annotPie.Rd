\title{A piechart of gene features input circRNAs are spliced from}
\usage{
annotPie(circs, other.threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{circs}{a list of circRNA candidates, loaded and annotated using \code{annotateCircs()}}

\item{other.threshold}{a minimum number of candidates feature should
have to be present in the pie-chart. Can be expressed
as fraction, or raw number.}
}
\value{
ggplot2 pie-chart
}
\description{
Describes proportions of circRNAs coming from particular gene features
(coding sequence, UTRs, introns, intergenic regions, ...). Low-frequency
features can be collapsed to "other".
